# This script applies GenericML() on the preprocessed data of
# a study by Cr√©pon et al. (2015, AER:AE, DOI: 10.1257/app.20130535).
# This randomized study investigated the effects of microcredit availability on
# household economic behavior in rural Morocco.
#
# The script outputs a file "GenericML_object.Rdata".
#
# The dataset was kindly made available by Esther Duflo.
#
# Note: your machine requires at least 6 cores to run this script.
# You may change "num_cores" to less cores (or even opt for no parallelization),
# but the results in the slides are only replicable for 6 cores on Unix machines
# (by virtue of parallel seeding)
